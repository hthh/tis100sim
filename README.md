# tis100sim
Unofficial TIS-100 simulator

This currently simulates the removed "PRIME DETECTOR" problem, for anyone who was working on that before it was removed. Image node simulation is not implemented.

To use, run with the path of your save file as the first argument.

This is intended as a fast cycle counter to augment the TIS-100 game, and to make it easier to experiment with optimizations or automate solution verifification. It is not intended as a game.
