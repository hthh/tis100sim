# tis100sim
Unofficial TIS-100 simulator

This currently simulates the removed "PRIME DETECTOR" and "SCATTER PLOT VIEWER" problems, for anyone who was working on them before they were removed.

To use, run with the path of your save file as the first argument (and the puzzle number as the second).

This is intended as a fast cycle counter to augment the TIS-100 game, and to make it easier to experiment with optimizations or automate solution verifification. It is not intended as a game.
