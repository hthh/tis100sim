# tis100sim
Unofficial TIS-100 simulator

This currently simulates to removed "PRIME DETECTOR" problem, for anyone who was working on that before it was removed. Image node simulation is not implemented.

This is intended as a fast cycle counter to augment the TIS-100 game, and make it easier to experiment with optimizations, or automate solution verifification. It is not intended as a game.
